# smart-farm_ML

Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy (pip install numpy)
Pandas (pip install pandas)
MatplotLib (pip install matplotlib)
Tensorflow (pip install tensorflow or pip install tensorflow-gpu)
Of course, to use a local GPU correctly, you need to do lot more work setting up proper GPU driver and CUDA installation.
If you are using Ubuntu 18.04, here is a guide.
If you are on Windows 10, here is a guide
It is also highly recommended to install GPU version in a separate virtual environment, so as to not mess up the default system install.

Keras (pip install keras)
NOTE: Most of the Jupyter notebooks in this repo are built on Google Colaboratory using Google GPU cluster and a virtual machine. Therefore, you may not need to install these packages on your local machine if you also want to use Google colab. You can directly launch the notebooks in your Google colab environment by clicking on the links provided in the notebooks (of course, that makes a copy of my notebook on to your Google drive).

For more information about using Google Colab for your deep learning work, check their FAQ here.
